            <h2>Why Tokyo?</h2>
            <h3>Tokyo, the New York of Eastern Asia</h3>
            <p>
              Tokyo is one of the most populous cities in the world and the
              second-most-populated capital globally. Located at the head of
              Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kantō region on the central coast
              of Honshu, Japan's largest island. Before the 17th century, Tokyo,
              then known as Edo, was mainly a fishing village. It gained
              political prominence in 1603 and by the mid-18th century, Edo was
              among the world's largest cities, with over a million residents.
              Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in
              Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was officially renamed Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of 2023, the city is home to 29 of the world's largest
              companies listed in the annual Fortune Global 500. Tokyo is an
              international research and development hub and an academic center
              with several major universities. Including the Greater Tokyo Area,
              it is the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world after
              New York, with a 2022 GMP estimated at $2.08 trillion (USD).The
              city is also recognized as one of the world's most livable ones;
              it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking,
              published in 2021. Tokyo has also been ranked as the safest city
              in the world in multiple international surveys.

                <h4>Asakusa</h4>
                <p>
                  Surrounded by water, Asakusa is the iconic Tokyo temple
                  complex and a town brimming with tradition. Passing through
                  Kaminarimon, one of several temples located in this ward is
                  Sensō-ji, a Buddhist temple dedicated to the bodhisattva
                  Kannon.
                </p>

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Alongside being a slice of the old in the middle of
                  metropolitan Tokyo, Asakusa is home to a bustling shopping
                  street, Nakamise, where you can find a lot of traditional arts
                  and crafts. It's also filled with some of the best restaurants
                  and food stalls you'll find in all of Tokyo.

                <h4>Harajuku</h4>
                <p>
                  Harajuku is known internationally as a center of Japanese
                  youth culture and trend-setting fashion. In addition to
                  all-day shopping, Harajuku has countless concept cafés where
                  you can play with animals, like otters and mini pigs, while
                  enjoying coffee.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  The prominence of Japanese street fashion alone is enough
                  reason to visit, but spending hours exploring all the
                  boutiques and backstreets is a great draw too. The sheer
                  diversity of style you'll encounter has to be seen to truly be
                  believed, especially for those with an interest in fashion

                <h4>Shinjuku</h4>
                <p>
                  A major commercial center and home to the busiest train
                  stations in all of Japan, there's a little bit of everything
                  in Shinjuku. It also boasts a large business district,
                  including the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Shinjuku has one of the most incredible shopping districts in
                  the world. Between electronics megastores and the more
                  high-end luxury department stores you can find, it has
                  something for everyone. It's also not too far from Shibuya
                  Scramble Crossing, one of the busiest pedestrian intersections
                  in the world.

              Hi! My name is Kathryn and (when I'm not coding) I like to travel.
              Japan is one of twenty countries that I've been to, and it was
              during my first trip there that that I visited Tokyo and fell in
              love. Out of all the many places I've been, Tokyo may be one of my
              favorite cities in the world.
