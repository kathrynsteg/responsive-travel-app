            <h2>Why Tokyo?</h2>
            <h3>Tokyo, the New York of Eastern Asia</h3>
            <p>
              Tokyo is one of the most populous cities in the world and the
              second-most-populated capital globally. Located at the head of
              Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kant≈ç region on the central coast
              of Honshu, Japan's largest island. Before the 17th century, Tokyo,
              then known as Edo, was mainly a fishing village. It gained
              political prominence in 1603 and by the mid-18th century, Edo was
              among the world's largest cities, with over a million residents.
              Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in
              Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was officially renamed Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of 2023, the city is home to 29 of the world's largest
              companies listed in the annual Fortune Global 500. Tokyo is an
              international research and development hub and an academic center
              with several major universities. Including the Greater Tokyo Area,
              it is the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world after
              New York, with a 2022 GMP estimated at $2.08 trillion (USD).The
              city is also recognized as one of the world's most livable ones;
              it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking,
              published in 2021. Tokyo has also been ranked as the safest city
              in the world in multiple international surveys.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Kathryn and (when I'm not coding) I like to travel.
              Japan is one of twenty countries that I've been to, and it was
              during my first trip there that that I visited Tokyo and fell in
              love. Out of all the many places I've been, Tokyo may be one of my
              favorite cities in the world.
